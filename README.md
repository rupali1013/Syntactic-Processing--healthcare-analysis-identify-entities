# Syntactic-Processing: Healthcare-analysis-identify-entities
In industry, Name Entity Recognition or NER has many dynamic applications such as:

- Search engines like Google
- Question answering systems like chatbot
- Medical and healthcare domain
- Text summarisation

# Problem Statement
Healthcare companies like BeHealthy generate vast amounts of medical data daily, including doctorâ€™s notes, prescriptions, and patient reviews. However, this unstructured text often contains complex medical terminology that is difficult for non-medical professionals to understand. Identifying diseases and their corresponding treatments from such text can be challenging due to implicit references and domain-specific language.

The goal of this project is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution that can automatically extract and map diseases to their respective treatments from medical text. This will enable better organization of medical records, assist healthcare professionals in decision-making, and enhance accessibility of medical information for patients.

**There are eight major tasks that we need to perform to complete it. They are as follows:**

1. Data preprocessing
2. Concept identification
3. Defining the features for CRF
4. Getting the features words and sentences
5. Defining input and target variables
6. Building the model
7. Evaluating the model
8. Identifying the diseases and predicted treatment using a custom NER
